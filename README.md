### 🧩 Introduction

In most football clubs, GPS, wellness, and fitness data are managed manually through Excel files exported from tracking systems like **Catapult**, **STATSports**, or **Wimu**.
While functional, this approach becomes inefficient as data grows — leading to **duplications, broken formulas, and inconsistent updates** that compromise long-term analysis.

This project replicates the **data infrastructure of a professional performance department**, showing how **modern data engineering** can transform that fragmented workflow into a **scalable, automated pipeline**.
Built with **Python**, **SQLite**, and **Power BI**, it turns raw CSV exports into a structured SQL database connected to live dashboards — supporting **evidence-based performance decisions**.

### 📊 Data and Metric Selection

Synthetic data (provided in the repo) simulate a realistic monitoring setup used in elite football environments.
Metric selection follows the **Quadrant Model** (Buchheit & Laursen, 2024), ensuring coverage of all key physiological domains:

| Quadrant                     | Domain                | Selected Variables                                 | Explanation                                                                          |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Metabolic Load**           | Internal              | HR Zones (THRZ), RPE                               | Practical and cost-effective proxies for internal load; THRZ used for micro-targets. |
| **Neuromuscular Load**       | Internal & External   | RPE, GPS metrics (distance, HSD, accelerations)    | Pragmatic external load indicators; reproducible without specialized hardware.       |
| **Metabolic Adaptation**     | Response & Adaptation | HR and lactate response in submax test             | Tracks aerobic efficiency without exhaustion.                                        |
| **Neuromuscular Adaptation** | Response & Adaptation | Jump tests (CMJ), isometric strength, bar velocity | Captures neuromuscular adaptation and performance capacity.                          |

> **THRZ (Time in Heart Rate Zones)** is central to the model.
> According to Buchheit et al. (2025), ~30 min/week above 90% HRmax supports aerobic fitness maintenance, with each additional 10 min yielding +1–2% performance gains.

### 🧱 Database Design

The database is the **core of the workflow**, ensuring data integrity and traceability.
Raw CSV exports (GPS, wellness, fitness) are unified into a **relational schema** that Power BI can query directly.

**Database Engine:** SQLite (for simplicity; easily scalable to MySQL or PostgreSQL).

**Main Tables:**

| Table             | Content                                          | Purpose                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| `players`         | Player profiles (age, position, anthropometrics) | Reference for all performance data |
| `session_metrics` | GPS & HR data per training session               | Quantifies external/internal load  |
| `wellness`        | Self-reported recovery metrics                   | Monitors well-being                |
| `fitness_tests`   | Periodic testing data                            | Tracks long-term adaptation        |

### 🔗 Power BI Dashboard

Once the database is built, it connects **live** to Power BI.
Every time new CSVs are added and processed, Power BI can **refresh automatically** to show the latest results.

**Dashboard views include:**

* **Weekly Load Summary** — total minutes, distance, HR zone time, RPE, sprint exposures
* **Training Distance by Day** — load variation across the week
* **Acceleration/Deceleration Profiles** — session intensity overview
* **Internal Load Trends** — RPE vs. HR zone time
* **Speed Exposure Analysis** — % of max speed reached (>95% alerts)
* **Filters** — Week, Day, Team, Player

These visualizations replicate the **data flow of professional performance departments**, enabling coaches and sport scientists to interpret training load and adaptation in real time.

### 🔁 Automated Update Workflow

1. Drop new daily CSVs into the project folder
2. Run `update_db.py`
3. Processed files move automatically to `/done`
4. Refresh Power BI to update dashboards instantly

This simulates a **live monitoring ecosystem** used in elite football environments.
